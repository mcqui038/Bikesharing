# Bikesharing

## Overview
This project focuses on bikesharing data from New York in the month of August. By analyzing this data, we are able to plan for a new bikesharing business in Des Moines, Iowa.

- Male subscribers are the most loyal bike users. 

## Summary
Overall the most popular times to rent a bike were Monday-Friday during commuting hours. The most loyal bike users were subscribers to the bike service. Most trips last less than 1 hour. One additional visualization to look at could be Starting Station by Usertype to see if there's a particular area where subscribers most frequently use. Another visualization would be to look at Bikeid and Tripduration to see which bikes have the most milage on them (and therefore which bikes will likely need to be serviced or replaced soon.)
